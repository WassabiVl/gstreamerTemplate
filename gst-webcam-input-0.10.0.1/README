Usage as a cheap infrared electronic whiteboard
===============================================
1. Buy a webcam that can support frame rate up to 30fps at dark condition
2. Unscrew the webcam and remove the infrared filter inside
3. Put a film negative to act as a infrared pass only filter
   (to block all visible light)
4. Project computer screen using a projector
5. Place your webcam towards the projector.
6. Use an infrared emitter as a pen (a infrared remote controller should work).
   You should point the pen towards and near (almost touch) the projected
   screen and let the webcam to capture the reflected light from the screen.
6. Adjust the distance between the webcam and projector, ensure all the screen
   projected area can be captured by the webcam
7. Run gst-tuio-setting, and tune the parameters, edit gst-webcam-input.conf
   manully if necessary. (The UI would not save it now)
8. Run gst-webcam-input
9. Do the 4 points calibration for the projection


Compilation and installation
============================
In order to compile gst-tuio you need following software packages:
        - Gstreamer development library
        - GTK Library
        - XTST library
        - X11 library
        - Unique Library
        - LIBLO Library

To configure run:
        ./configure --prefix=/usr 

Configure automatically searches for all required components and packages.

To compile and install run:
        make && make install


What is the different between Community Core Vision ?
=====================================================
The idea and setting layout are from Community Core Vision.
But gst-tuio is completely rewritten and does not depends on OpenCV, and
designed with optimization bare in mind.
So much lower CPU usage (~10%) with my notebook running 1.83GHz
